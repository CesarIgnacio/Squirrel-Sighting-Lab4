# About our Repository

The purpose of creating a shared group repository is to manage our work and effectively collaborate efficiently. Our repository serves as a guide to give users a more detailed description of the project that we have been working on. The organization of our repository is like this:

### Squirrel-Sighting

This is our main folder where we arrange our files and folders. The two folders are SquirrelAPI and Quiz 4.

Under this folder we have the following files:

    * create-db-squirrel.sql

This file contains the code for creating our database on MySQL.

    * reports.json

This file contains data for our API POST operations.

    * sight_locations.csv, sight_report.csv, squirrel_desc.csv

This files contain data for insertion into our database through MySQL.

### SquirrelAPI folder

It contains instructions for installations and setting up your local development environment along with the sample .json package files, the makefile, and, the main program for our API.

### Quiz 4 folder

Contains data that we used for our first database report.

### Makefile and additional information on installations.

Since we are using Express.js for our API endpoints creation, to be able to use some of the files in this repository, the user needs to install the following items:

  - MySQL Community Server
  - NPM and Node
