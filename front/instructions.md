# How To Run FrontEnd

The Backend Repository we worked with was strcutured in way that we could not access the database remotely therfore in order to actually test the frontend.

Then follow all steps to get the backend up and running locally on your device. After you successfully have set up the backend you simply open the index HTML file and and everything should work.
